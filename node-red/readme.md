Node Red Flows

Emerging Tech Weekender

If you want a quick way to plumb together your Internet of Things application, Node Red provides a quick graphical editor and good support for services.

We've created a Node Red VM you can install into Oracle VirtualBox (free) and be up and running very quickly. Ask one of the mentors and they'll either give you the VirtualBox image or spin you one up on the server.

We're using PubNub to share the data from the devices, so we've built Node Red with support for PubNub and a default Hello World application. If you want to examine a flows file have a look at helloworld-flows.json and paste it into Node Red's Clipboard Import feature.
